Hello to our valued customers, partners, and the cybersecurity community,

We are thrilled to announce something that has been in the works for quite some time now. We've always believed in making cyber risk management and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) more accessible, transparent, simple, and effective for everyone. Today, we're taking a significant step in that direction by making our flagship products, Mira and CISO Assistant, available as open-source software through a Community Edition.

## Why Open Source?

**Community Collaboration:** The challenges of cybersecurity are ever-evolving. Going open-source allows us to collaborate with a vast community of developers, industry experts, and end-users. Together, we can better shape and evolve the GRC tools landscape.

**Transparency:** In a domain like cybersecurity, trust is paramount. By opening up our source code, we're offering complete transparency, so you know exactly what you're implementing in your systems and how sensitive data are being processed.

**Accessibility:** Our mission has always been democratizing cyber risk management and GRC tools. With free-to-use Community Editions, smaller businesses can also implement best-in-class cybersecurity measures and benefit from the community expertise.

## What’s Included in the Community Edition?

Mira and CISO assistant core features are open-source and free to use. All future general usage features will be as well. Visit the website to learn more about their capabilities.

Community editions will benefit from both community support as well as the regular maintenance and bug fixes that we will keep doing on the internal branches.

There is no change on the enterprise edition, where customers can request custom features that we’ll maintain as the product grows. Custom-made features will not be part of the community edition unless agreed on with the customer. Enterprise edition benefits from direct and priority support, as well as advanced assistance for setup, integration, and team coaching.


## How to Get Started?

This is the easy part. Just head over to our GitHub repositories, clone them, and follow the instructions on the readme files.

- Mira Repo is here: [https://github.com/intuitem/mira-community]

## Don’t want the setup?

We have a free 30-day trial, and no credit card is required. Head out to [https://intuitem.com/fr/trial/].

We automatically create isolated demo infrastructure even for the trial to keep your data private and secure. You’ll get a notification email once it’s up.

## A Big Thank You!

We want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has supported us thus far. We're excited to see where this new chapter takes us, and we can't wait for you to be a part of it.

Best regards,

intuitem Team
